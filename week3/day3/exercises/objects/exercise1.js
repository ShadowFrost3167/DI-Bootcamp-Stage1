// 1. Create an object that has properties "username" and "password". Fill those values in with strings.

let user = {
    username: "Shadow",
    password: "sonic2",
};

// 2. Create an array which contains the object you have made above and name the array "database".

let database = [user];

// 3. Create an array called "newsfeed" which contains 3 objects with properties "username" and "timeline".
//Made 3 usernames and wrote them down for visual aid:           Avi     Ariel      Ronnie
let newsfeed = [
    {username: "Avi", timeline: "I'm having a good Chanukah!"},
    {username: "Ariel", timeline: "~Chilling at the beach smoking green~"},
    {username: "Ronnie", timeline: "Go hard or go home, never stop grinding!"}
];
//so to create an array we use let and the name of the array then the hard brackets and within the array we put each object in curly brackets with their features separated by commas.
