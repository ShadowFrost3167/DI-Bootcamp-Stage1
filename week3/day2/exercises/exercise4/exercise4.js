// For each expression, predict what you think the output will be in a comment (//) without first running the command.

let c;
    let a = 34;
    let b = 21;

    console.log(a+b) //first expression
    // Prediction: let c = whatever the console log declares in how the elements within that variable interact since it's addition 34+21 will be 55. I think it will output 55.
    // Actual:It outputted 55 just like I thought. 

    a = 2;

    console.log(a+b) //second expression
    // Prediction: I think since it's lower in the code that the console will read underneath the 55 an integer of 23. since 2+21=23. so it will read 55 and then underneath 23. 
    // Actual: It outputted both the 55 and the 23 like I predicted.

// What is the value of c?

// C has a value of whatever the result of a and b are depending on the relationship they have within the definition of c. so if they were added together the value would be the sum, if one of the parameters changes then the result changes.

// Analyse the code below, what will be the outcome?
console.log(3 + 4 + '5');

//The outcome will be:
//    75
//it will log the number 7 as the sum of 3+4 and it will pass 5 as a string since there are quotes. since there is no space before the five it may appear as one number rather than 2 distinct results within the expression.
