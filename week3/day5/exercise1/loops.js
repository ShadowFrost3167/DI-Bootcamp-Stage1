// Exercise 1

// Create a structured HTML file linked to a JS file

// 1. Write a JavaScript for loop that will iterate from 0 to 15. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is odd or even, and display a message to the screen.

        // Sample Output: //"0 is even" //"1 is odd" //"2 is even"
for (let count = 0; count <16; count++){
    if (count % 2===0){console.log(count + " is even");}
    else{
        console.log(count + " is odd");
    }
}
