// ðŸŒŸ Exercise 1: Simple If/Else Statement
// Instructions

// Create 2 variables, x and y. Each of them should have a different numeric value.


// Write an if/else statement that checks which number is bigger.

        // Example :

        // let x = 5;
        // let y = 2;


// You should display:
// x is the biggest number

let x = 42;
let y =7;

if (x > y){
    console.log("x is the biggest number");
}

//it took me a while to really understand what the homework exercise wanted me to do for this but once i finished writing what i have above the structure of the if statement and application became clearer to me.
