HTML Basics Exercise
Last Updated: September 22nd, 2023

Before You Start Working On The Project
In your computer, inside the Desktop or the Documents folder, create another folder named DI-Bootcamp-Stage1.
Add a subfolder named HTML-Basics to the DI-Bootcamp-Stage1 folder.

Important ! From now on, when you create a new folder or a new file, avoid spaces in the name.
For example, instead of “HTML Basics”, write “HTML-Basics”

Structure:

DI-Bootcamp-Stage1
├───HTML-Basics
   └───cookies-exercise.html


Cookies Exercise
Open the HTML-Basics folder in your Code Editor, then create a new file named cookies-exercise.html.
Write the necessary HTML, and open the page in your browser. It needs to look just like this one:
