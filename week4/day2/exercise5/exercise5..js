// Exercise 5 : Whatâ€™s In My Wallet ?
// Instructions
// Note: Read the illustration (point 4), while reading the instructions


// Create a function named changeEnough(itemPrice, amountOfChange) that receives two arguments :
// an item price
// and an array representing the amount of change in your pocket.

let quarters = .25;
let dimes = .1;
let nickels = .05;
let pennies =.01

let currency = [quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies];

function changeEnough(itemPrice, amountOfChange){

    let sum = (amountOfChange[0]*currency[0]+amountOfChange[1]*currency[1]+amountOfChange[2]*currency[2]+amountOfChange[3]*currency[3]);

   
    

    if (sum>=itemPrice){
        return true;}

    else{
        return false;
    }
    }

    console.log(changeEnough(4.25, [25, 20, 5, 0]));
    console.log(changeEnough(14.11, [2,100,0,0])); 


// In the function, determine whether or not you can afford the item.
// If the sum of the change is bigger or equal than the itemâ€™s price (ie. it means that you can afford the item), the function should return true
// If the sum of the change is smaller than the itemâ€™s price (ie. it means that you cannot afford the item) the function should return false

// Change will always be represented in the following order: quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies.
// A quarters is 0.25
// A dimes is 0.10
// A nickel is 0.05
// A penny is 0.01


// 4. To illustrate:

// After you created the function, invoke it like this:

// changeEnough(4.25, [25, 20, 5, 0])
// The value 4.25 represents the itemâ€™s price
// The array [25, 20, 5, 0] represents 25 quarters, 20 dimes, 5 nickels and 0 pennies.
// The function should return true, since having 25 quarters, 20 dimes, 5 nickels and 0 pennies gives you 6.25 + 2 + .25 + 0 = 8.50 which is bigger than 4.25 (the total amount due)


// Examples

// changeEnough(14.11, [2,100,0,0]) => returns false
// changeEnough(0.75, [0,0,20,5]) => returns true
